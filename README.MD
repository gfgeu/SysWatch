# SysWatch

SysWatch is a system monitoring tool that provides real-time performance metrics of your system such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, temperature, and more.

## Installation

To install SysWatch locally in your project, you can use npm:

```bash

```
This will install SysWatch as a local dependency in your project.

## Usage

Alternatively, you can navigate to the `node_modules/syswatch` directory and start SysWatch by running:
